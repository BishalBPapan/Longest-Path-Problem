let the length of longest path be at least k.

No of clauses = q (1....q)
No of variables = n (1....n)

start node to start_vertex_1 node = 1
end_vertex_n node to start_clauses node = 1
start_clauses node to start_clause_1 node = 1
end_clause_q node to end node = 1

each loop has 2*(q+1)
n loops = 2n*(q+1)

edges between claues = q-1
jumping to next variable = n-1
jumping from clauses to variables = 2*q
total = 4 + 2n*(q+1) + q-1 + n-1 + 2*q
