\begin{frame}{Longest Path Problem is NP-Hard}

   
 We now show longest path problem is NP-Hard. 
  \begin{itemize}
        \item<2-> To do so, we show that the longest path problem is at
least as hard as the 3-SAT problem.

   
\begin{block}{Claim}
% \textbf{3-SAT Problem $\leq_p$ Longest Path}
\textbf{3-SAT $\leq_p$ Longest Path}
\end{block}
    
    
    \end{itemize}
