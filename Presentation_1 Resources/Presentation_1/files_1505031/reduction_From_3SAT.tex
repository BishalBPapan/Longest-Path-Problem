\begin{frame}{Reduction from 3-SAT formula}

   

  \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> At first, we need to convert an instance of \textbf{$3-SAT$} problem to an instance of \textbf{$Longest Path$} problem.
        \item<2-> As the instance of $Longest Path$ problem must be a graph, we will show the process of converting a $3-SAT$ equation, $Y$ to a $Longest Path$ problem instance, which will be a graph $G =(V,E)$.
        \item<3-> This construction takes polynomial time.
        
     \begin{block}<4->{Value of k}
        $k=2+2n+(3+n)q$
     \end{block}      
     \begin{block}<4->{Claim}
        Y is satisfiable if and only if G has a path of length at least k.
     \end{block}
        \item<5-> Now we will show the conversion steps from $3-SAT$ to $Longest Path$.
    
\end{itemize}
