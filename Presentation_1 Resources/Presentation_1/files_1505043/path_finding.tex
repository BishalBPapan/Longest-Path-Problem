\begin{itemize}
    \item Starting from $s$, we take exactly one path, either True Path or False Path from each loop representing a variable $x_i$. We color this path with $green$.
    \item According to this way, after reaching the end vertex of the $n^{th}$ variable, $e_n$, we add $c_{start}$ and $c_{1_{in}}$ to the path.
\end{itemize}
