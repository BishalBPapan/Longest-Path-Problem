\begin{itemize}
    \item For the $gadget$ corresponding to each clause $C_j$, there are three choices.
    \item For each clause, we take any of the three choices so that no node on the $green$ path is again traversed by the chosen path from the $gadget$. We color this path with $pink$.
    \item We add $t$ to this path.
\end{itemize}
