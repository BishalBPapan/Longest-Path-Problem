abstract="The longest path problem is to find a longest path in a given graph. While the graph classes in which the Hamiltonian path problem can be solved efficiently are widely investigated, very few graph classes are known where the longest path problem can be solved efficiently. For a tree, a simple linear time algorithm for the longest path problem is known. We first generalize the algorithm, and it then solves the longest path problem efficiently for weighted trees, block graphs, ptolemaic graphs, and cacti. We next propose three new graph classes that have natural interval representations, and show that the longest path problem can be solved efficiently on those classes. As a corollary, it is also shown that the problem can be solved efficiently on threshold graphs.",

abstract = "The class of bipartite permutation graphs is the intersection of two well known graph classes: bipartite graphs and permutation graphs. A complete bipartite decomposition of a bipartite permutation graph is proposed in this note. The decomposition gives a linear structure of bipartite permutation graphs, and it can be obtained in O(n) time, where n is the number of vertices. As an application of the decomposition, we show an O(n) time and space algorithm for finding a longest path in a bipartite permutation graph."

abstract = "The longest path problem asks for a path with the largest number of vertices in a given graph. In contrast to the Hamiltonian path problem, until recently polynomial algorithms for the longest path problem were known only for small graph classes, such as trees. Recently, a polynomial algorithm for this problem on interval graphs has been presented in Ioannidou et al. (2011) [19] with running time  O(n4) on a graph with  n vertices, thus answering the open question posed in Uehara and Uno (2004) [32]. Even though interval and circular-arc graphs look superficially similar, they differ substantially, as circular-arc graphs are not perfect; for instance, several problems– e.g. coloring –are NP-hard on circular-arc graphs, although they can be efficiently solved on interval graphs. In this paper, we prove that for every  path  P of a circular-arc graph G, we can appropriately “cut” the circle, such that the obtained (not induced) interval subgraph  G′ of  G admits a path  P′ on the same vertices as P. This non-trivial result is of independent interest, as it suggests a generic reduction of a number of path problems on circular-arc graphs to the case of interval graphs with a multiplicative linear time overhead of  O(n). As an application of this reduction, we present the first polynomial algorithm for the longest path problem on circular-arc graphs. In addition, by exploiting deeper the structure of circular-arc graphs, we manage to get rid of the linear time overhead of the reduction, and thus this algorithm turns out to have the same running time  O(n4) as the one on interval graphs. Our algorithm, which significantly simplifies the approach of Ioannidou et al. (2011) [19], computes in the same time an  n-approximation of the (exponentially large in worst case) number of different vertex sets that provide a longest path; in the case where  G is an interval graph, we compute the exact number. Moreover, in contrast to Ioannidou et al. (2011) [19], this algorithm can be directly extended with the same running time to the case where every vertex has an arbitrary positive weight."

abstract={The longest path problem is the problem of finding a path of maximum length in a graph. As a generalization of the Hamiltonian path problem, it is NP-complete on general graphs and, in fact, on every class of graphs that the Hamiltonian path problem is NP-complete. Polynomial solutions for the longest path problem have recently been proposed for weighted trees, Ptolemaic graphs, bipartite permutation graphs, interval graphs, and some small classes of graphs. Although the Hamiltonian path problem on cocomparability graphs was proved to be polynomial almost two decades ago, the complexity status of the longest path problem on cocomparability graphs has remained open; actually, the complexity status of the problem has remained open even on the smaller class of permutation graphs. In this paper, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the longest path problem on the class of cocomparability graphs. Our result resolves the open question for the complexity of the problem on such graphs, and since cocomparability graphs form a superclass of both interval and permutation graphs, extends the polynomial solution of the longest path problem on interval graphs and provides polynomial solution to the class of permutation graphs.},
