        \item The following diagram shows that 3-SAT, Hamiltonian Path, Traveling Salesman Problem are polynomial time reducible to Longest Path Problem.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item We could not find any problem which is reduced to longest path problem. Because, as the tree moves down, the problems tend to get harder from the previous ones.
        \item As longest path problem is harder than any known NP-hard problems, we couldn't find any problem that reduced from longest path problem.
